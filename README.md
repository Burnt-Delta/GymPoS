# GymPoS
A graphical addendum to my Databases final project: a simple gym PoS interface that allows a receptionist to perform various interactions with a member.

If the program is succesfully able to connect to the database, it will display a receptionist login window.

Upon logging in with a valid recID, the receptionist will be greeted with the following main screen.

From here, the receptionist can check in a member, view a list of all classes, start a new membership, and cancel a membership.
Below are the windows for the "See Classes" and "Start a Membership" features.
